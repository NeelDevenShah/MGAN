## Implementation of MGAN (Multiple/Mixture of Generative Adversial Net)

This TensorFlow code implements an example of MGAN for the CIFAR-10 dataset, presented in the paper "MGAN: Training Generative Adversarial Nets with Multiple Generators" accepted at the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018).

The code was made by Neel Shah for the image deblur project
